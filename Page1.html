      <h2>Natural Therapy:</h2>
      <p>Firstly, living in or near the forest is proven to keep your brain in a healthier state (a report on this topic******). Those who live in a city have a higher chance of developing some 
        mental disorders and an overworked amygdala. On the other hand, those who live in a city 
        but also near a forest were less likely to develop those mental disorders, and were proven 
        to deal better with stress.</p>

      <h2>Free and healthy air freshener:</h2>
      <p>Secondly, living near a forest provides you with fresher and healthier air. While this might 
        sound like a clich√©, it is a lot more than that. Fresh air boosts our immune systems, since 
        we breathe in the natural chemicals that plants release to defend themselves (an article about this******). The same website claims that living near a forest also lowers your 
        blood pressure, improves your mood, increases your ability to focus, accelerates recovery
        time, increases energy level, and improves your sleep.</p>

      <h2>Beautiful surroundings:</h2>
      <p>Finally, Haarlemmerhoutkwartier has many walking paths through the forest and park that
        can be great for family recreation, including your family members on 4 paws. They are well
        maintained, but also make you forget that you are in the middle of the city. There is also a 
        farm with sheep, deer, llamas, and other animals that are all visible over a fence that is short 
        enough for people of all heights and ages to see. Around that farm is a completely accessible
        walking path that also leads to more paths through the forest. In some fields, people meet
        with their dogs in the morning and let them socialize, run and have fun.</p>
